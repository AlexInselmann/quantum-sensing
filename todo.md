## To do 

Should do
- [ ] read the paper in the litterature folder (Alex)
- [ ] Try out qutip tutorial 
- [ ] Predict steady state as a function of samples and g.
- [ ] Write up the 
- [ ] make NN baseline 

Could do 
- [x] computationally optimize the simulated data in von neumann jypiter

Questions
- [ ] What kind of data will we use, and what should we predict?
    - [ ] when do we reach steady state? (the probability to be in a steady state at a given time)
- [ ] What pphysical model should we use? (Von neumann?)
- [ ] what physical attributes/varabiles do we know from the experiment? measurement record(!)
